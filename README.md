# UFOs

## Overview
Created web page to filter through data we've collected

## Results
The filtering process is very easy and will be very helpful for the viewer to find exactly what they're looking for. For example, if the viewer wanted to find all sightings in Florida, they would simply type in the state abbreviation, "fl", and hit enter and the results will appear.

If the viewer wants to filter the data even more and only see fireball shapes, they simply type "fireball" into the shape filter and hit enter and the results will filter even further.

## Summary
One drawback of this new design is that it doesn't include all items that can be filtered. I would include 'Duration' as a filter as well so the viewer is able to filter any way they want. Also, this data only includes 13 days in January of 2010. I would suggest adding more data in more months and years so the viewer would get the most accurate information.
